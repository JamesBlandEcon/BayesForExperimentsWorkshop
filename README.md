# Structural Bayesian Techniques for Experimental and Behavioral Economics workshop

You will need a folder called "data" in this directory's parent directory to get the code to run.
You can download the data from the following locations:
* Harrison and Swarthout (2023):
    * Data available on Glenn Harrison’s website here: http://cear.gsu.edu/gwh/
    * I am using GSUData.dta from the “house money” folder
    * Rename this to "HS2023.dta"
* Dal Bó and Fréchette (2011): https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.101.1.411
* Goeree, Holt, and Smith (2017): https://github.com/JamesBlandEcon/ApproxQRE/tree/main/data
    * Use "GHS2017VD.csv"
